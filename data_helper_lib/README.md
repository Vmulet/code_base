# data_helper_lib

## Introduction
Welcome to **data_helper_lib**! This library was developed to handle data processing for our analytics pipeline and pretty much every code I developed to work. As I transition out of the company, I wanted to ensure a smooth handover so you can easily integrate and extend this library in future projects.

## Features
- **CSV to Parquet (`csv_to_parquet.py`)** – Easily convert CSV files into efficient Parquet format or Parquet to CSV.
- **File Manipulation (`file_manipulation.py`)** – Handle file operations for data analysis.
- **Data Formatting (`format_data.py`)** – Standardize and clean datasets by formatting dates, strings, and numerical values.
- **Data Retrieval (`get_data.py`)** – Fetch and load data from local files.
- **PDF Creation (`pdf_creation.py`)** – Small code to use PDF generation in Python.
- **Plotting (`plot.py`)** – Create plots for visualizing data, including line charts and bar graphs.
- **Energy Analysis Plot (`plot_energy_analysis.py`)** – Specialized plotting functions tailored for analyzing and visualizing energy data trends.

## Installation
To install the library, run the following command:

```sh
pip install data_helper_lib
